This is a test repository for practicing basic git functionality.


What is git?
Version control system. IT allows us to
1. keep our code edits organized.
2. back up our code edits when we push to remote.
3. keep track of the code edits of multiple collaborators, and point out if there are any conflicts.



Cheat sheet


`git init`

creates a new git repository in the current directory

`git status`

shows you which branch you are on, and all the edits that git is tracking in this repository

`git log`

shows you the last commits in this branch

`git commit`

adds edits to the commit

`git add`

adds files to the repository to be tracked by git

`git push`

pushes to the remote repository

`git checkout`

allows you to checkout a different branch

`git checkout -b`

with the -b flag, it will switch to the branch, or create one if it does not exist. It will branch from the current checked out branch.


When you 'git init', git creates a .git folder in this folder. That's where it stores all the commits, or every version of the repository for you to check out.

`.gitignore`

 file tells git to ignore certain files
